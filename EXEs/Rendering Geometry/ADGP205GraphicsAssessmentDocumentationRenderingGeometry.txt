Graphics Assessment Documentation for “Rendering Geometry”


Purpose:
Introduce the steps needed to create our own geometry using shader files and math to calculate geometry vertices and indices. 


Learning Outcomes:
1. Learn how to draw various shapes: a plain, a cube and a sphere.
2. Learn how to create and use shader files: a vertices shader and a fragment shader.
3. Learn how to read data from a file: read the data stored in the shader files.
4. Learn how to calculate the vertices and indices for a sphere using math.
5. Learn how to store the data by using buffers and binds.


Learning Outcomes that were performed:
1. The Project can draw a plain, cube, and sphere at the same time. The plain, cube, and sphere have their own functions were they are constructed. Custom draw functions are used to setup what needs to be drawn and these custom draw functions are called in the draw function.
2. Shader files were created by creating new text files in the projects folder. One is named vsInfo and the other is fsInfo.
