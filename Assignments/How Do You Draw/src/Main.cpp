Morning gist:

In your own words, answer this very simple question.
"How do you draw?" You have 2 hrs and you can use your own
code as reference and notes. This is an assessable 
question after 4 weeks of graphics.

/*
"How do you draw?"

Before we begin drawing, data buffers need to be created that
OpenGL reads from (vertex and index information). A vertex
struct should be created to hold vertex information. This
struct will hold the position and color of data type vec4.
We need three varibles of data type unsigned int. Three
varibles are m_VAO, m_VBO, and m_IBO.
