Graphics Assessment Documentation for “Rendering Geometry”


Purpose:
Introduce the steps needed to create our own geometry using shader files and math to calculate geometry vertices and indices. 


Learning Outcomes:
Learn how to draw various shapes: a plain, a cube and a sphere.
Learn how to create and use shader files: a vertices shader and a fragment shader.
Learn how to read data from a file: read the data stored in the shader files.
Learn how to calculate the vertices and indices for a sphere using math.
Learn how to store the data by using buffers and binds.
