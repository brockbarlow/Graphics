Graphics Assessment Documentation for “Intro to OpenGL”


Purpose:
Introduce the steps needed to create our own OpenGL projects that allow us to experiment with modern OpenGL rendering techniques.


Learning Outcomes:
1. Learn how to setup the GLFW and OpenGL libraries, linking them in Visual Studios using the environment variable $(SolutionDir).
2. Learn how to use inheritance: OOP design involving a base class and classes that will inherit from this base class.
3. Learn how to setup and use virtual functions.


Learning Outcomes that were performed:
1. GLFW, glm, gl_core_4_4, and gizmos were included into the project through the properties window.
2. Project has a base Application class the gets inherited by the Solar System class.
3. The base Application class has four virtual functions: start, update, draw, and end. The Solar System class overrides these four virtual functions.
