Assessment ADGP 205 - Graphics


Graphics Assessment Documentation for “Cameras and Projections”


Purpose:
Introduce the steps needed to create our own moveable camera that allows us to move around our rendered objects.


Learning Outcomes:
1. Learn how to create a camera class that uses matrix math to translate, rotate, and scale about it’s origin.
2. Apply the newly created camera to the solar system project.


Learning Outcomes that were performed:
1. Using the math provided during class, the camera class has been created with custom rotation function instead of using the built-in glm rotate function. The math that was went over was the rotation matrix. 
2. The custom camera has been applied to the solar system project. During play, the user can move the camera while viewing the solar system.
